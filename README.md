# What the F!? is encryption?
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
>In short encryption is to ensure that your information is safe and only those you give access to it with a key can do so.

# What about decryption?
Decryption on the other hand is the opposite of encryption, while your data is safe, yet it is unreadable and so decryption comes into play in which a user with 
key will use the key to decrypt the encrypted file.

# CryptoJS Library
JavaScript implementations of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms
CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.
If you have a problem with CryptoJS, if you want to discuss new features, or if you want to contribute to the project, you can visit the CryptoJS discussion group.

## CryptoJS offers a variety of features:
- [x] Hashing
- [x] HMAC
- [x] PBKDF2
- [x] Ciphers
- [x] Encoders
